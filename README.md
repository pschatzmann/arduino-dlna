# Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA)


## Brief

This example demonstrates the process of running a UPnP/DLNA media renderer in Arduino.

The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) aims to establish the interoperability among PCs, consumer appliances, and mobile devices in wireless networks and wired networks. The purpose is to provide a solution for sharing between digital media and content services.
